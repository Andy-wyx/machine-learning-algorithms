## Introduction

A summary of interesting machine learning models and reinforcement learning algorithms with my implementations. Here are some of my notes and docs related: [notion](https://www.notion.so/summer-thu-sz-13d58b2885294bf9bee02dc5a645c219?pvs=12) and [hand written notes](https://www.notion.so/summer-thu-sz-13d58b2885294bf9bee02dc5a645c219?pvs=12) (Not published yet)
 
## Requirements
Try to follow this [installation guide](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/user/installation.html) and [installation notes(not published yet)](https://www.notion.so/env-bfe60b79233548d7b439fadac94ba9a4)
* **python**
* **miniforge/anaconda**
* **tensorflow**
* **torch**
* **gym**
* **mujoco**
* **mujoco-py**
* **numpy**

## TBD
### Algorithms
* LSTM
* rainbow dqn
* more implementation of Evolutionary Algorihms (EA) i.e. Genetic Algorithm and Evolution Strategy
* PPO
* distributed learning in RL (parallel or asynchronous)
### Trainning the model
* a better CNNï¼Œ maxpooling ...
* frameskipp
* some reward engineering
* NAS: Network Architecture Search
### Others
* Encapsulate the flappy bird env (you can even try to publish it onto the Gymnasium) 
* add save & load 
* enable human mode
* enable GPU mode
* enable CPU/GPU utilization monitoring

## Disclaimer
The work is based on the repo [uvipen/Flappy-bird-deep-Q-learning-pytorch](https://github.com/uvipen/Flappy-bird-deep-Q-learning-pytorch). 

There are many repos about flappy bird agents or some other atari games, you might find some of them useful as well:
